            The city sky's feeling dark tonight<br>
            We're back to back with our heads down<br>
            Just look at me, give me more tonight<br>
            Just give me more of your love now<br>
            Let's set fire to the lonely night<br>
            You're beautiful when you look at me<br>
            Let's give love another life<br>

        </p>

        <p id="para2">
            Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine<br>
            Just call my name on the edge of the night<br>
            And I'll run to you, I'll run to you<br>
        </p>

        <p id="para3">
            I would run to you<br>
            I would run to you, If you want me to<br>
            Just give me some kind of reason<br>
            I'll take the pain, take it all away<br>
            Give it some kind of meaning<br>
            Let's let go, let it be the start<br>
            You know I'm feeling the same thing<br>
            Let's let go of our broken hearts<br>
        </p>

        <p id="para4">
            Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine<br>
            Just call my name on the edge of the night<br>
            And I'll run to you, I'll run to you<br>
            Even if it's gonna break me, love<br>
            Gonna make my way to you<br>
            Anyway it's gonna take me, love<br>
            I run to you<br>
            I run to you<br>
        </p>

        <p id="para5">
            Run, run<br>
            Cause you'll be safe in these arms of mine<br>
            Just call my name on the edge of the night<br>
            And I'll run to you<br>
            I'll run to you<br>
            Even if it's gonna break me, love<br>
            I run to you
